This repository contains a frontend app called GitHub Cards, which is designed to demonstrate basic React and SPA framework functions.

GitHub Cards takes advantage of the GitHub API, allowing users to retrieve basic GitHub profile information by searching for a specific username. Essentially, a user can search retrieve profiles for 1 or more GitHub users, and add or delete as many as desired.

GitHub Cards utilizes React as its framework, PrimeReact as the UI component library, and a variety of CSS tools including flexbox.
